# Apollo_client

This is a client copied from [rcssserver](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssmonitor), and rewrite with `CMake`.

With its help, we can get a better understanding of model in 2D soccer simulation platform(of rcssserver).

## Background

In fact, the official has provides a `rcssclient` and there's an [Official tutorial](https://rcsoccersim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/soccerclient.html) that tell you how to use it. But I think it expose two much 'noise message' and it experience is really terriable.(Of course, it's not designed for 'good experience')

So I decide to separate it from its source and make its better for Apollo2d.

## Application

- manipulate player with command line.
- automatically start and end a game.(to be done)
